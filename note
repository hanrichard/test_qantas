## Review notes

Code:

  Server end:
  * Unnecessary line breaks found in files. i.e server.js
  * Semi-colon missing in files. i.e server.js
  * Remove commented lines of code
  * Move server.js, package.json under project root to server dir
  * airport type/resolve not used? remove them

  Client end:
  * Some deps are devDep not deps - i.e react-test-renderer, waait
  * .env, HeaderStyle.js not used. Remove it
  * Indentation inconsistencies found in two queries in queries dir - consistency! either 2 or 4, but need to be the same across the whole project
  * Semi-colon is missing in some files - make sure you are consistent on this. all-or-nothing!
  * Remove unused css selector in AirportDetailsStyle.js
  * Logic code in Home.js with ln between 35 and 39 needs to be externalised into utils file and get unit tested
  * Move `const Wrapper = styled.div`${componentStyle}`;` to outside of Home component in Home.js
  Wrapper can be seen in other places as well. Make sure they are all placed outsided of main component.

Functionality:
  * Not fully functional when offline. i.e fetch a particular item fails. I thought you would have read the item from cache as discussed?

ReadMe:

Confusing and sketchy. you need to be clear around how a reviewer can run your app without much guessing.

* You need to have a short description on what this app is about and what it does
* What techs you've chosen to complete this task
* What is this project composed of - a server and a client?
* How to run this app - how to install deps on server and client.
* Any assumptions? Node, npm pre-installed etc.
* Any particular versions required? i.e node version >= 10.0.0?
